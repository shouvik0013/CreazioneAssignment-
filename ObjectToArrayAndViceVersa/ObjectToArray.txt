=========================== Object to Array ==============================


There may be many ways but I found these four ways:
	There are four ways to convert an Object to an Array ->
		METHOD 1: Object.values(obj) will return an array of values of the given object

		METHOD 2: Object.entries(obj) will return an array of key-value pairs of the
		          given object
		
		METHOD 3: Object.keys(obj) will return an array of keys of the given object
		
		METHOD 4: From Object.keys(obj) we will get an array of keys, from
				these keys we can generate a new Array with values of the given keys
